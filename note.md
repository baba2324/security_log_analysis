Research Note: From Semiconductor Logic to Cybersecurity Anomaly Detection

Trial:Instead of using conventional baseline models, I directly developed a Custom CNN architecture by inheriting the semiconductor anomaly detection logic from Brainworks (AI Startup Grand Prize Winner).

Observation:During the process of reshaping 1D network logs into 2D spatial matrices for CNN training, I encountered 6 critical runtime errors related to input dimension mismatches.

Next Step:Executed an intensive 10-minute debugging sprint to iteratively refine the input dimensions and model layers. Resolved all 6 structural errors, achieving a stabilized training pipeline.

Research Direction: Validated that semiconductor-grade spatial anomaly detection can be successfully generalized to cybersecurity domains, achieving a final F1-Score of 0.96
