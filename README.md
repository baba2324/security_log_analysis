# AI Security: Network Intrusion Detection

## 1. Project Overview
- **Objective:** Detect malicious network attacks (DDoS, Probe) using AI.
- **Dataset:** NSL-KDD (Network Security Benchmark).
- **Solution:** Re-purposed the industrial anomaly detection model (Random Forest) to cybersecurity data.

## 2. Key Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, Scikit-learn (Applied Anomaly Detection Logic)
Chosen for its high interpretability and stability in handling small-to-medium security datasets.
## 3. Key Result
- **Detection Rate:** **90%+** (Classified Normal vs. Attacks)
- **Insight:** The results suggest that industrial anomaly detection logic can be effectively applied to security log analysis.

  ## 5. Limitations & Future Work
- This project is a **creative application** that modifies the **source code and logic** learned during the **Industrial AI Expert Training Course (60 hours)**.
- The original industrial anomaly detection pipeline (taught by **Brainworks CEO Kang Woo-hyeon**) was re-engineered for cybersecurity.
- Validated using the **NSL-KDD Benchmark Dataset**.
- Future work includes validating this approach on real-world security logs.
